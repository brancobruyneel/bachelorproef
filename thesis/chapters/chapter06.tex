One big 2018 goal for the Rust community is to become a web language. By targeting WebAssembly, Rust
can run on the web just like JavaScript. But what does this mean? Does it mean that Rust is trying
to replace JavaScript?

The answer to that question is no. We don’t expect Rust WebAssembly apps to be written completely in
Rust. In fact, we expect the bulk of application code will still be JS, even in most Rust
WebAssembly applications.

This is because JS is a good choice for most things. It’s quick and easy to get up and running with
JavaScript. On top of that, there’s a vibrant ecosystem full of JavaScript developers who have
created incredibly innovative approaches to different problems on the web.
